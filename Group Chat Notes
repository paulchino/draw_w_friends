Group chat Feature

On chat upload
- ask for name and select room
- On popup model save the name and the room on form submit and send to server

How to get the existing lines uploaded for a new user


function serialize(canvas) {
    return canvas.toDataURL();
}

function deserialize(data, canvas) {
    var img = new Image();
    img.onload = function() {
        canvas.width = img.width;
        canvas.height = img.height;
        canvas.getContext("2d").drawImage(img, 0, 0);
    };

    img.src = data;
}

1. The server listens for a new connection
2. When a new connection occurs an emit to the clients asks for the deserialized string.
3. The 



on load, want user to show what has been drawn



features/Notes
1. When a user updates his brush settings an emit is sent to update to all other users

2. When a user logs, the existing brush strokes from the other users must be displayed. Needs to be a way to save the canvas with all the brush strokes

3. Group chat. Save the db?




What is required to show strokes on other users
- each user
	var el = document.getElementById('paint')
	var ctx = el.getContect('2d');


Each user has a socket ID
When a new user connects have a contructor create a new object


Server Side
On socket connection 
//send to everyone
io.emit('create_user', {id:socket.id, name: name });

Client Side
io.sockets.on('create_user', function(user) {
	//create a new Object
	var user.id = new User(user.name, user.id, ___ some other stuff);

})




Client Side
function User(name, id, ___what else needs to be sent) {
	//these variables are private. Bound to new object

	var el = document.getElementById('paint');
	var ctx = el.getContext('2d');
	var isDrawing;
	var penCol = 'black';
	var lineWidth = 6;
	
	this.name = name;
	this.id = id;

	this.lineWidth = __;
	this.penCol = __;


	//
	various methods to update the coord and brush properties
}
